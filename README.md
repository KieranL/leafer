## BOM

- Motor (with matching esc)
  - 380 size brushless motor (max 29mm diameter) ~3000kv (untested)
  - C3530 Outrunner 1400kv (slow on 2s but decent on 3s)
- 2-3s LiPo ~2000mah
- MR83 3x8x3 bearings
- MR128 8x12x3.5 Bearings
- 1/10 scale servo or 9g servo
- 70-80mm shock
  - I use 70mm but if you want it to sit a littler higher 80mm works
- 48mm Mini E-Revo shocks for skis (Optional)
- 150g 85a TPU for track and hood hinge/straps
  - 95a may work but the track will not be nearly as flexible and take more power to turn
- 1kg rigid filament
  - PLA+/Tough PLA works well but most components it does not matter
- M3 screws
  - Mostly 8mm, 12mm, and 16mm
- Motor drive pulley
  - 12t 2GT pulley for 380 motor
  - 16t 2GT pulley for 3530 Outrunner
- Driven pulley
  - 68t for 380
  - 64t for C3530
- 188mm 2GT Closed loop belt
