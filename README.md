 A 3D printed RC snowmobile styled after machines from the 70s

Currently a work in progress and there is a very good chance files and BOM will change

## BOM 

Electronics have been tested to work in this config unless noted

Note: some of these are affiliate links

- Motor (with matching esc)
  - 380 size brushless motor, 19mm hole spacing (max 28mm diameter) ~3100kv
    - Expensive, nicer option [Rocket Supersonic sensored 380 3300kv](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DdVOuNJ)
    - Cheap option with servo [Rocket 2845 3100kv](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001562382697.html)
  - C3530 Outrunner, 25mm hole spacing 1700kv (slow on 2s but decent on 3s)
    - [ESC Quicrun 16BL30](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DcZGKr3)  [Motor C3530 1700kv](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DBsAxyv)
  - 540/36xx size motors _should_ in theory work with same mounting holes as the C3530 but are quite a bit heavier
- 2-3s LiPo 1000-2200mah
  - 2200mah 2s gives around 25-30 minute run time in low snow/icy conditions with a 3300kv sensored 380 motor 
    - I run CNHL Black Series 1300-1500mah 2-3s batteries that fit well in the front. There is also room under the seat but I don't recommend putting the battery there
- Battery strap
- 2-6 MR83 3x8x3 bearings (optional, 2 for front idler wheels and some for a belt tensioner if needed)    
- 12x MR128 8x12x3.5 Bearings
- 1/10 scale servo or 9g/TR4 servo
- 70-80mm shock
  - I use 70mm but if you want it to sit a littler higher 80mm works
- 48mm Mini E-Revo shocks for skis (Optional)
- 150g 85a TPU for track and hood hinge/straps
  - 95a may work but the track will not be nearly as flexible and take more power to turn
- 1kg rigid filament
  - PLA+/Tough PLA works well but most components it does not matter
- M2 Screws
  - 6-8mm long for the spindle covers
- M3 screws
  - Mostly 6mm, 8mm, 12mm, and 16mm
- Motor drive pulley
  - 12t 2GT 3.175mm bore (or 5mm bore with shaft adapter) pulley for 380 motor
  - 16-20t 2GT 4mm bore pulley for 3530 Outrunner
- Driven pulley (printable options will be included)
  - 58-64t for 380
  - 58-64t for C3530
- 188mm 2GT Closed loop belt

## Remaining work

- Handlebars
- Windsheild
- Tail light for seat
