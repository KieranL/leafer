# Leafer

 A 3D printed RC snowmobile styled after machines from the 70s

Currently a work in progress and there is a very good chance files and BOM will change

## BOM 

Electronics have been tested to work in this config unless noted

Note: some of these are affiliate links

- Motor (with matching esc)
  - 380 size brushless motor, 19mm hole spacing (max 28mm diameter) ~3100kv
    - Expensive, nicer option [Rocket Supersonic sensored 380 3300kv](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DdVOuNJ)
    - Cheap option with servo [Rocket 2845 3100kv](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001562382697.html)
  - 540/36xx size motors should work with same mounting holes as the C3530 but are quite a bit heavier
- 2-3s LiPo 1000-2200mah
  - 2200mah 2s gives around 25-30 minute run time in low snow/icy conditions with a 3300kv sensored 380 motor 
    - I run CNHL Black Series 1300-1500mah 2-3s batteries that fit well in the front. There is also room under the seat but I don't recommend putting the battery there
- Battery strap
- 6+ MR83 3x8x3 bearings (4 for rear idlers, 2 for front idler wheels and some for a belt tensioner if needed)    
- 8x MR128 8x12x3.5 Bearings
- 1/10 scale servo or 9g/TR4 servo
- 70-80mm shock
  - I use 70mm but if you want it to sit a littler higher 80mm works
- 48mm Mini E-Revo shocks for skis (Optional)
- 150g 85a TPU for track and hood hinge/straps
  - 95a may work but the track will not be nearly as flexible and take more power to turn
- 1kg rigid filament
  - PLA+/Tough PLA works well but most components it does not matter
- M2 Screws
  - 6-8mm long for the spindle covers and front bumper
- M2.5 Screws (if using ski shocks)
  -  2 10mm, 2 16mm
- M3 screws
  - Mostly 6mm, 8mm, 12mm, and 16mm
- M3 Threaded rod
  - skid rear axle and steering links
- Motor drive pulley
  - 12t 2GT 3.175mm bore (or 5mm bore with shaft adapter) pulley for 380 motor
  - 16-20t 2GT 4-5mm bore pulley for 36XX
- Driven pulley (printable options will be included)
  - 58-64t for 380
  - 58-60t for 36XX
- 188mm 2GT Closed loop belt
- short piece of gt2 belt for front limiter strap
- 8mm aluminum/steel driveshaft if not using the printed one
  - slightly shorter overall but the bolt spacing is the same as skeeride 2 shaft which will also fit

## Printing

- Print the track, hood straps, hood hinges, snow flap, and spindle covers in TPU
- The spindles need to have really good layer adhesion so make sure to use a strong material and maybe bump up the hotend temp a bit
- Material choice for most other parts does not matter but the springs I would suggest PC-ABS or PLA+
- Some parts will need supports
  - the tunnel has integrated supports included

Note: The rear axle cross shaft and front cross brace look the same, but the rear one has a larger hole so you can slide a threaded rod through, where as the front is smaller so you can thread a bolt into it


## Remaining work

- Handlebars
- Windsheild
- Tail light for seat
- clean up CAD and release newest CAD
